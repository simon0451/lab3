get strain vs. time for the vibrating beam data
use peak determinating to find the peaks for these data
---somehow find the damped natural frequency from this, damping ratio, and natural frequency... ogata or the j-lab book may be useful for this
---see problem 3.43 (in j-lab book) for description - this method uses least squares there is also the equation in the lab with the lns
